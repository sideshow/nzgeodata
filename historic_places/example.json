  "history": "This historic place was registered under the Historic Places Act 1980. The following text is the original citation considered by the NZHPT Board at the time of registration. \nSt Stephen's Chapel the small wooden church at Judge Bay, Auckland replaced an earlier stone chapel built for Bishop Selwyn in 1844. The latter structure designed by Sampson Kempthorne had collapsed in July 1845 only seven months after its opening.\nThe new chapel was designed by Frederick Thatcher and opened in early 1857. It is an aesthetically pleasing, well proportioned structure similar in general appearance to the other 'Selwyn Churches' of the time. It has a shingled roof pitched at 60\u00c2\u00b0, vertical board and batten cladding, lancet windows and an exposed timber frame on the interior. However what makes St Stephen's unusual, indeed unique amongst early New Zealand churches is its plan. This is in the form of a Greek Cross in contrast to the traditional Latin cruciform plan of other churches by Selwyn\/Thatcher partnership. The second chapel was almost certainly built as a venue for the Constitution of the United Church of England and Ireland in New Zealand Conference and the signing of the Constitution there on 13 June 1857. The Greek Cross plan of St Stephen's synonymous with the establishment of the Church in the first three centuries after the death of Christ, could therefore be seen to parallel symbolically the setting up of Church government in New Zealand with the signing of the constitution. \nThus, the historical significance of St Stephen's lies in the chapel's association with this very important event in the history of the Church of England in New Zealand, its link with Bishop Selwyn and the fact that it occupies the site of one of the first churches built in New Zealand under his direction. Also, the cemetery around the chapel contains the graves of many of Auckland's most illustrious early settlers.",

  "history": "Ruatuna is the birthplace of Gordon Coates (1878-1943), a prominent Northland politician and a former Prime Minister of New Zealand. Built in 1877, the kauri timber house was originally erected for Coates' parents, Edward (1843-1905) and Eleanor (1851-1935), as the main residence for an extensive estate in the northern Kaipara. Edward Coates came from a well-connected English gentry family, and had arrived in New Zealand in 1866. After obtaining 5,196 hectares (12,830 acres) of land in the Ruatuna area, much of it leased from local Maori, he experimented with introducing new animal breeds, importing the first Shropshire Down sheep to New Zealand and the first Hereford cattle to the North Island. Edward Coates also initiated changes to the landscape, including the creation of orchards and hedged fields from previously 'unimproved' ground. The residence was built in preparation for his marriage to Eleanor Aickin in 1877 and was located on elevated ground towards the northern end of the estate, overlooking the Kaipara Harbour which afforded waterborne transport to the area. \nThe eldest of several sons, Gordon Coates took over the part-running of the farm in 1900, before being elected to the Otamatea County Council (1905). A few years after winning the parliamentary seat of Kaipara in 1911 he joined the conservative Reform Party, which traditionally represented the interests of farm owners and which promoted especially strong ties of loyalty to the British Empire. He occupied the Public Works (1920), Native Affairs (1921) and Railways (1923) portfolios before taking up the post of Prime Minister from 1925 to 1928. He also held further office in the 1930s and early 1940s, including as Minister of Armed Forces and War Coordination in a special administration during the Second World War (1939-45). \nThe single-storey homestead was a comparatively humble structure, reflecting the pioneering nature of the family enterprise and perhaps its construction on leased land. It was erected as a simple, gabled building with a verandah at the front, and lean-to rooms on either side. Constructed by a local builder, Samuel Cooksey, the building fused the symmetry of early colonial architectural traditions with features of the newer Gothic Revival style, including prominent central gables at the front and rear. Its interior also exhibited Gothic-influenced elements, notably a front parlour and kitchen\/dining room in the main body of the building that were both open to the roof with the pegged timber frame of the house fully visible. Family tradition has ascribed its appearance as being modelled on that of a Scottish hunting lodge, a building type with historically strong aristocratic associations. In nineteenth-century Britain, Gothic Revival and related styles harked back to a past when landed families and other high-status groups were considered to have been secure in their social position, so aspects of Ruatuna's appearance could be interpreted as reflecting ongoing English gentry aspirations or nostalgia. Gothic architecture was also frequently used to embellish buildings in large estates and parks, increasing their Picturesque qualities and alluding to concepts of antiquity and grandeur. \nAssociated outbuildings around the dwelling included a dairy, a general shed and a privy, which were all necessary for a self-sufficient homestead. A separate cottage was also constructed within the grounds. A woolshed and stables complex beyond the immediate domestic curtilage pre-dates the house and was heavily used in the early 1900s, when the property boasted the largest flock of Shropshire Down sheep in the country. At this time, many workers on the estate were Maori. Changes to the house have been comparatively few, but they included an added bedroom for Gordon Coates when he reached adolescence, and a schoolroom for his sisters' education, both undertaken in 1893. Following the departure of each of the sons - including Gordon - by 1918, alterations by an all-female household included a new kitchen, a bathroom and two additional bedrooms. Extensive nineteenth-century gardens around the dwelling were maintained. Ruatuna was noted for its social gatherings, which included popular tennis parties. A grass tennis court in use at the front of the house by 1905 was concreted in 1929. \nFollowing continued use by the Coates family, the house and almost 2.5 hectares (six acres) of land was left to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust\/Pouhere Taonga in 1976. Much of the associated farm had previously been subdivided and sold in the late 1940s. Remaining farmland was retained within the family until 1997, when it was purchased by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust\/Pouhere Taonga. The house and its outbuildings are currently being conserved (2008) for future opening to the public. \nRuatuna is nationally significant for its association with the country's first New Zealand-born Prime Minister, Gordon Coates, and the rural pioneering background that helped to shape his political views. It is valuable for its links with the development of stock breeding in New Zealand and the introduction of new types of cattle and sheep. The place demonstrates important changes to the ownership and use of the land in the northern Kaipara during the later colonial period, including the creation of large private estates. It also reflects late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century rural attitudes to self-sufficiency, home education, sanitation and other aspects of daily life, and has links with subsequent farming by an all-female household. The main dwelling is architecturally significant as a well-preserved 1870s structure, which fuses Gothic and Georgian forms and which also incorporates an unusual domestic interior influenced by medievalist approaches. The place is important as part of a more extensive historic landscape, which includes agricultural outbuildings and other features linked to a broader farming estate.",
