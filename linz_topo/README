= LINZ NZTopo Processing Scripts =

Part of the NZ GeoData Scripts project:
  http://code.google.com/p/nz-geodata-scripts/

This script generates Shapefiles or PostGIS tables from the raw LSLIFF data 
(*.iff files) as provided to purchasers of the LINZ NZTopo extracts. Each layer 
in the LSLIFF theme (a .iff file) ends up as a Shapefile or PostGIS table.

Requirements:
 - Python >= 2.4
 - GDAL/OGR, built with the Python bindings & the PostgreSQL driver

For support, head to the NZ Open GIS group at:
  http://groups.google.co.nz/group/nzopengis

== Running the converter ==

To display help and usage information:

  python iff2.py --help

To convert to a set of shapefiles:

  python iff2.py --shapefile out/ /path/to/my.iff

Output shapefiles will be created in the out/ directory.

To convert to PostGIS tables:

  python iff2.py --postgis "dbname=mydb host=myhost user=myuser port=5432 password=mypass" /path/to/my.iff

Notes:
 * for Chatham Islands data, you will need to make sure EPSG:3793 is recognised
   by GDAL as well as PostGIS. See http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3793/
 * If you're getting weird file errors, you may have run into the maximum open
   files limit for your system. This is quite possible under OSX, less so Linux.
   You can increase the limit using ulimit (eg. 'ulimit -n 1024').
